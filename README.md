# Sort_Movies_based_on_imdbRating
*Sort movies based on their IMDB ratings.*

In this project i used [**omdbapi**](https://www.omdbapi.com/]) to fetch every movie data like Title,Year,imdbRating,... 

#**NOTE**
if you want to use that api you must sign up [**here**](https://www.omdbapi.com/]) and you can get your *apikey* and use it **1000** times *every day*.

Also i used [**IMDB API**](https://imdb-api.com/api) and downloaded a simple Dataset. In this directory **"..\IMDb-API sample data\Sample-Data IDs\Movies.txt"** of that dataset you can find a *.txt* file that i called it **MoviesIMDB_Id.txt** , in this file you can find the ID of 250 best movies on **IMDB**.
In my project i imported that file and with **OMDBAPI** fetched data from 5 randomly selected ID and sorted them by their **IMDBRating**s. 
And finally saved them in **IMDB_Sorted_based_on_imdbRating.txt**.
